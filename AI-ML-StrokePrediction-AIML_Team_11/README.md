# About the project
This project of stroke prediction has been done by AIML Team 11 of Virtusa Codelite Hackthon
All other necessary details has been provided in the Jupyter Notebook File.

## Setting up the environment
1. Clone the project into your local machine by using the `git clone https://github.com/iamneowise/AI-ML-StrokePrediction-AIML_Team_11.git` command in your terminal.
2. Go to the project folder in your terminal (for example: `cd D:\path-to-project\AI-ML-StrokePrediction-AIML_Team_11`)
3. Install all the requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` command in your terminal.

## Running the web_app.py file
1. After installing all the required files, run `streamlit run web_app.py` command in your terminal to fireup the website in your localhost.
2. If you want to use different port than the default, run `stremlit run web_app.py --server.port (port_num)` in your terminal (for example: `streamlit run web_app.py --server.port 8080`)

### Note:
The submission.csv file consists of predicted values using the trained model.
please refer Stroke Prediction.ipynb for further details.
